### Best Practices
- **For News Monitoring**: Use VADER method for fast analysis of large volumes

- **For Social Media**: VADER handles informal language and emojis best
- **For Reports**: TextBlob provides additional subjectivity insights
- **For Filtering**: Start with category filters, then refine with score ranges

## Translation Quality Tips

- **For News Articles**: Use "High Quality" mode for better sentence structure
- **For Short Content**: "Standard" mode is usually sufficient
- **For Complex Content**: Use "Best Quality" mode for maximum accuracy
- **For Large Datasets**: Start with "Standard" mode to test, then upgrade if needed

## Troubleshooting

If translations are still poor quality:
1. Check that the source text is in the expected language
2. Try different quality modes
3. Ensure the text is not too short (minimum 50 characters)
4. Check the console output for translation service errors

## Technical Details

The translation system uses:
- **Google Translator**: Primary service (free, reliable)
- **Google Translator**: Secondary service
- **MyMemory Translator**: Tertiary service
- **Sentence-by-sentence processing**: For high-quality modes
- **Automatic fallback**: If one service fails, tries the next
